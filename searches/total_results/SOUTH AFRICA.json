Cryptocurrencies are digital representations of value supported by cryptography and function within a global computerised ledger system called the blockchain. Cryptocurrencies are multifaceted with its use extending beyond an alternative payment method. Cryptocurrencies are not issued nor controlled by a central regulatory authority, hence, they are not considered to be legal tender in South Africa.  \r\nCurrently, as at September 2019, cryptocurrencies are not directly regulated in South Africa. South African financial regulators, particularly the South African Reserve Bank and the South African National Treasury caution users about the risks associated with cryptocurrencies and vigorously indicate that citizens have no recourse to South African authorities. On the other hand, the South African Revenue Service indicates that citizens must declare their cryptocurrency gains and losses",
