In other words, we examine the relationships between (a) de jure openness to cryptocurrency and institutional strength, and (b) de jure openness to cryptocurrency and de jure capital openness.

To measure the de jure openness to cryptocurrency, we compose an index of 218 economies by using the current legal and regulatory status of cryptocurrency compiled in 2018. Our results show that effective governance institutions are associated with a less restrictive regulatory stance on cryptocurrency, wher",
