These equate to special drawing rights that are not legal tender but can be used for payments. According to this view, trading or brokerage in virtual currencies is viewed as requiring a financial services license under the Banking Act. This view was previously criticized by a criminal court, but the point is otiose as of January 2020 due to the special way that Germany has implemented the Fifth Money Laundering Directive",
